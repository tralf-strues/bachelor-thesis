### Abstract
This work is dedicated to the development of a frame graph and the investigation of its connection with the abstraction layer over graphics APIs (Render Hardware Interface, or RHI). A method for integrating this mechanism directly into the abstraction layer was proposed. As a result, an efficient implementation of the frame graph was developed using Vulkan API. Additionally, a high-level renderer was designed and implemented as proof of the practical applicability of the chosen design.
